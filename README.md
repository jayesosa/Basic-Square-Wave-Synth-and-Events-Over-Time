# Basic-Square-Wave-Synth-and-Events-Over-Time
This is a program in Arduino made for an Arduino Teensy. The output is now in the form of a square wave as audio. The potentiometer still controls the delay between each output being played so when the potentiometer is turned down to a lower value (to the left), you can hear the audio only as short pops with a large amount of silence between each pop. As you turn the potentiometer  value increasingly higher (to the right), the interval of delay between each output becomes less and less and the output audioâ€™s pitch increases until it plays a single high tone. This is mimicking the way the LED would just continuously stay lit when the pot was turned all the way to the right and when the button was held down.
